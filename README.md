## Implementation

There are four levels. The first is to introduce the 3 enemies, the second teaches the player to jump, then the third teaches them to wall jump. Last, the fourth level is a combination of all of them, making it bigger and more maze-like so the player has to explore to find all the monsters. 
I drew the stars for the background, the portal to the next level, the three aliens, the ship parts, the idle and jumping pose, and a 7 frame walking animation. 
I also added music to each level.
Not sure if this counts for a point, but I made the charging enemy able to go left and right.
